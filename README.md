# Kaznowski Brothers Blog

Project created so we could write about cool tech stuff we have learnt/are learning while making our own CMS + everything around it.

Initially we will be focusing on creating the blog page and engine and from there we will get into more interesting topics such as custom build systems and other components

The entire purpose of this project is to do cool stuff for the sake of doing cool stuff.
